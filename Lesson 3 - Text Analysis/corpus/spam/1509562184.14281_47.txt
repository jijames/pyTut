(FoxNews, 10.31.2017) - There has been a lot of heated discussion about the legalization of marijuana. Whether you are for or against doesn't matter when discussing the amazing benefits of CBD. CBD is the non-psychotropic part of the hemp plant, so it's legal in all 50 states. CBD has received a lot of media attention for its unbelievable health benefits. CBD is successfully being used in the treatment of stress and anxiety, chronic pain, PTSD, heart disease, depression, brain, prostate and pancreatic cancer, and much more more.
