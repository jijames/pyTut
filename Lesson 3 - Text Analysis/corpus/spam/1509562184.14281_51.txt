<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">(Beauty Report, 10.30.17) by Callie Thorpe - We've all heard of the "grapefruit-diet" that's been around since the 50's, which was ultimately deemed too few calories, too low in carbs, unhealthy and potentially dangerous!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Today, nutritionist Dr. Kelly Ann Petrucci, of the Oz Show, tells us about a new spin on an old idea.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://climb.hwnrc.trade/grapefruit-diet"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Read the Full Story Here.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">"It's been in. It's been out. But today it's back and grapefruit's better than ever. This new and improved detox turbocharges fat-burning. Compounds in this detox duo use modern science and a host of super-nutrients. So, unlike fad-diets that included little more than grapefruit and black coffee, this is a way of doing it that is smart."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">The New Grapefruit Detox promises quick results - as much as 10Lbs in 12 days - due to fat-burning enzymes found in grapefruits. It promises these results without starvation and eating normal meals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Dr. Oz and his team have created a foolproof product for today's busy woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">"We've already seen a huge amount of evidence that it works. In fact, our test subjects have lost 9-10 Lbs in just 7 days, and up to 30 Lbs in just 12 weeks. The approach is winning raves from everyone who uses it - including numerous celebrities and public figures."</span></p>

I came here right after this opened a few years ago and the food was good but the waiter/host made dinner really uncomfortable.... Friendly servers. Great drinks of all types. Southern influenced menu. Open and more cosey seating. First visit to a Cheddars. Kind of an Applebee's or TGIFridays price point and atmosphere. Despite there being lots of available seating in this large... first let me say, service was super friendly... BUT, my martini was not a martini...and as much as I hate to send food back, I had to send my mussels back!... So much fun and the food was delicious.

I recommend the prime rib or the sirloin. And... I've been staying here on and off for the past 2 years when I'm in town for business. This is one of those rare places that you will occasionally find... What a great place!  We're not familiar with the area but found this gem on Yelp and were not disappointed.

Pretty cool joint with an oldie worldie diner feel. The menu is pretty big and they have ice cream shakes and root beer and a diner bar as well as big group... The food is delicious and the service is great!  If you like Mexican check this place out!! Good food great prices!   Was nice to find in a small town  Very clean facility what a wonderful surprise! Great local spot. A ton of selections on the menu. Huge portions. .... one item could feed two hungry people. Pie? Yes please. Excellent service, food, \u0026 location!! I would like to post a picture of my meal, very filling. Eggs, hashbrowns, bacon \u0026 toast. Cooked perfectly :-)f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047</span></p>
