We are locals and never considered going to blend until tonight and we are so happy that we finally tried it! ....The food was amazing! ....We had: the calamari... Met with friends for dinner here since they are knowledgeable around the area and I looked at the menu previously and always wanted to try this place out.... My Girlfriend and I went for dinner last Saturday Night. I had heard great things, but I wasn't getting my hopes up too high. Well let's just say that it... Bright spot after a rainy day. Dinner lived up to the reputation on yelp. Arugula salad was fresh and interesting. Oysters Rockefeller were very tasty.... This used to be the Black Trumpet, a forgettable restaurant with a view of the shoreline. ..The new Bareli is an improvement over the previous failed... Let me set the table for you.  Overcast, almost chilly August day 'down the shore'.  We have in tow a friend who lives nearby, and has been wheelchair bound... Shore Fresh Seafood is a cute, quaint hole in the wall seafood restaurant. I stumbled upon this place on Yelp while my family and I were vacationing in... Confession! I am a BENNY from New York and come here throughout the summer to hang with my Wall friends. This place is amazing.....The crowd is amazing -... This landmark does not disappoint at their brunch  and lunch hour salad bars. Menu items can be questionable but have had more hits than misses!   ....You can... On a Sunday night I find myself in town for business. I look up Yelp. \"Where to eat?\" I'm thinking. Las Cocina has high reviews. I drive 8 minutes from... Breezed through at 1am not expecting much, and Iron Skillet far exceeded these albeit low expectations. The service was terrific; our waitress was timely... Visited here last evening.  Very nice family style restaurant.  Food was good, nothing to rave a lot about.  Good good, good service.  Staff very friendly.... The food was great, and the service was quick and with a smile. Definitely recommended! When you go to a fast food location, you have an idea of what the experience will be.  My experience at this Wendy's was awesome, hands-down.....The service... I love Mitchelle's.  I visit there every summer when we visit Aurora. Mexican restaurant next door offers breakfast/lunch/dinner.  Go visit if you are in town. I've actually been impressed the couple of times I've been here. We were just there at 12:30pm on a Saturday, and still we received fresh, hot food quickly... We were pleasantly surprised with this place on our drive across country. All the dishes had good flavor and the staff was very friendly:)f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047</span></p>
