Subject: Health on Skin: Remove Unwanted Moles Without Surgery or Burning

Content-Type: text/plain

(Health, 10.31.2017) We sat down with dermatologist, Dr. Amy White, to ask her about her non-surgical, at-home mole and skin tag solution and how it works.
"I've seen a huge change in the 10 years that I've had my practice. And my partners have as well. People are more interested in natural remedies. They want something that is free of chemicals, harsh side effects, and the unknown. They are looking for cures that are healthy for their bodies. To be honest, burning, freezing and surgery are the only ways we dermatologists had of removing skin tags and moles in the past. That just seemed so barbaric to me. I knew there had to be another way.", Dr. Amy White.
