Easy to miss from the road if you aren't looking for it but if you like Thai food you should stop here Great food! It does taste very typical home made style. We came for the good and stayed for the drinks. Highly recommend this place. You would think they have been mastering their craft for years....the food is legit. Pulled pork isn't your mundane usual crockpot action. ....Worth the stop.... A cute place with white table cloths and twinkling lights.  I had the quiche and fruit which were delicious.

It was fresh and quite good and the service was excellent. I sat at a table (I loathe hibachi grill seating) and had a miso... This is a wonderful neighborhood \"Mom an Pop\" eatery!  Wonderful ice cream cones!  The food is also very good!  Great place to go that is walking distance... Good food but Great service!  Not traditional smoked brisket, but very good flavor. Quality ribs with a lot of meat. This is a Fantastic place for Pizza and everything else they serve!  The pizza crust was absolutely perfect. Thin and crispy!  I will defiantly recommend... By far one of my favorite dinner choices!  The food is great and the beer is cold. I highly recommend the Scoobie. Yum yum!! My family of 6 LOVED what they got!!..Great service and great experience all around!f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047</span></p>
