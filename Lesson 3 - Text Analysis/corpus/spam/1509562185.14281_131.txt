My wife and I were able to stop in and eat at bitters and bones.....The parking was a bit strange but it is in town parking.  The place was beautiful inside.... We recently visited our friends who live near the SUNY Potsdam campus.  When deciding what to do for dinner, they said Jake's on the Water was an absolute... My time spent at SLU was certainly highlighted by many an Early Bird at 1844 House! Such amazing, high-quality, locally-sourced food! And while not cheap,... For our first visit to Lake Placid, this was a delicious introduction to the food culture. We are from NYC, and weren't expecting much considering we... Exceptional! One of my best dining experiences. Coming from NYC, I have frequented high quality restaurants. This place is unbelievable. Everything was... So worth the 2 hour wait.....Wanted to try the shepherd's pie croquettes, but they were sold out by the time we got seated around 8.....Ordered the sampler... We went for lunch on a rainy day. Loved the seafood shack design and adorable back deck with 3 small tables for two. If the weather is good, I'd highly... There's beer. Delicious beer.....And there's food. Really satisfying pub food. ....But the greatest thing?....There's a kids' playroom. ....Ingenious.....If you're... We have come here two years in a row for our anniversary.

I'm here for a couple of days and hope to find time to comeback again. The chicken chowder was flavorful with tender chunks of dark meat chicken.  Then I... GREAT food. I can't think of anything I didn't like about lunch here. The pretzels were fresh and oh-so soft. I think my fiance still has dreams about them.... I really enjoyed my latest meal Saturday afternoon at toasted frog. I got the quinoa bowl and it was delicious! Service was great and prompt. It was a... Hummus, Lamb Burger, Baklava. ....Food was amazing, owner was fantastic. Didn't think I'd find good Greek food in Fargo but was happy to be wrong! If you want amazing food and excellent service, Doolittles is your place. Our service tonight was great as usual (Waited on by Phoenix- she was fabulous). I... Really excellent food, wine list and staff. Sara is lovely. We had the grilled Caesar salad with salmon, the wings with hot sauce and the pretzels.
