<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">(Beauty Report, 01Nov2017) by Callie Thorpe - We've all heard of the "grapefruit-diet" that's been around since the 50's, which was ultimately deemed too few calories, too low in carbs, unhealthy and potentially dangerous!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Today, nutritionist Dr. Kelly Ann Petrucci, of the Oz Show, tells us about a new spin on an old idea.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://classroom.niteil.trade/body-transformation"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Read the Full Story Here.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">"It's been in. It's been out. But today it's back and grapefruit's better than ever. This new and improved detox turbocharges fat-burning. Compounds in this detox duo use modern science and a host of super-nutrients. So, unlike fad-diets that included little more than grapefruit and black coffee, this is a way of doing it that makes sense."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">The New Grapefruit Detox promises quick results - as much as 10Lbs in 12 days - due to fat-burning enzymes found in grapefruits. It promises these results without starvation and eating normal meals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Dr. Oz and his team have created a foolproof product for today's busy woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">"We've already seen a huge amount of evidence that it works. In fact, our test subjects have lost 9-10 Lbs in just 7 days, and up to 30 Lbs in just 12 weeks. The approach is winning raves from everyone who uses it - including numerous celebrities and public figures."</span></p>
