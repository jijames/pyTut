Two Brothers become millionaires overnight because of Shark Tank.

Read the Exclusive Story Only Here>>> http://deposit.chohay.stream/exclusivestory-sharktank 

We were just passing through the area and this place is a diamond in the rough. I felt immediately at home, I think the bartender /chef was the owner.... Excellent... I shouldn't have to type anything else... If you don't come here and eat, you would definitely be missing out on great food, atmosphere,... all food is amazing!!! service is served with a smile and if you're lucky a laugh!!! drinks are beyond amazing coming from the best bartender around... Great food, a little gem that doesn't feel like it belongs in the area, would do well in a much bigger city. ....We came in late covered in mud from mountain... One of my favorite places to eat in Carlisle. We would go more often if the hours worked with our schedule. I always have trouble describing Momma Spriggs... I am so glad I listened to the positive reviews. Today is a long day of driving and this was a comforting placef8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
